# thesis_appendix 
This repository contains the scripts used to produce the results and plots presented in my thesis "Transcriptomic profiling of glia in Huntington's disease".

Scripts that are prefixed with a number are part of the snRNAseq analysis pipeline. 

The remaining scripts are either for the purpose of analysing validation results, or generating plots in addition to those generated as part of the pipeline above.
